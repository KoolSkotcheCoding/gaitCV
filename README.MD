# gaitCV

## Description

This project aims to describe trajectory of leg movement. The goal is to recognize the patterns of running gait.  

## Background

The gait analysis is useful and very popular in the running community. It helps professional atheletes to identify running patterns and correct bad habits in the future training. Amaeuter runner can also benefit by determing pronation type and choosing right shoes to prevent potential injury. While the gait patterns has been studied a lot in sports medicine and artificial neural networks have been utlized in the recent publication (Begg-Kamruzzaman2006, Herrero-Jaraba2002, Islam2016). Most of them requires manual features extraction to some degree, which limited size of training data and undermined the power of neural network. In this project, we are planning to utilize openCV library to analyze runner profile videos that are publicly available in Youtube. At the first stage, we are going to identify differences in running gaits by certain characterics of runners, such as age and race, using CNN.
